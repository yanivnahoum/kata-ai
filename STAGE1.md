# 🚨 Stage 1: Wild Copilot (15 min)

**Goal**: See Copilot's default behavior (spoiler: it's not great)

1. Open Copilot Chat (`Ctrl+Shift+I`)
2. Type: `Build discount engine as described in EXERCISE.md`
3. Let Copilot generate **everything**
4. Run `npm test` → **Document what breaks**

**WRITE DOWN** (in comments):

- Missing tests?
- Wrong logic?
- Magic numbers?
- Poor structure?
- Test without 'it.each'?
- Constants missing?
