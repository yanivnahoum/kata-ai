## Discount Engine Kata Instructions

This project involves creating a Discount Engine that calculates discounts based on various criteria.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the application and test the discount calculations.

### Requirements

- The engine should support multiple discount types.

### Coding Standarts

- Use TypeScript with strict typing.
- Follow functional programming principles.
- Avoid magic numbers; use named constants instead.
- Write pure functions with clear input and output.
- Use descriptive variable and function names.
- Const variable should be inside a \*.const.ts file
- Utils functions should be inside a \*.util.ts file

### Testing

- Make sure to write unit tests for each discount type and edge cases.
- Prefer using `it.each` for parameterized tests.
- Mock data should be inside a \*.mock.ts file
- Test files should be named as \*.test.ts like the example: `discountEngine.test.ts`
- Achieve at least 90% code coverage.
- Use a consistent testing framework (e.g., Jest).
